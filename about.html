            <h2>About the Artist</h2>

            <p>S.S. Shankar (Richard Lazzara) is a yogi artist whose work represents "Art for the Soul" - a path of liberation through art. Based in Boulder, Colorado, Shankar has dedicated his life to creating visionary paintings that bridge Asian mysticism with Western artistic innovation.</p>

            <h3>Training & Background</h3>
            <p>Starting as a child with notable art talents, Shankar took night courses at Brooklyn Museum Art School, then went on to Maryland Institute College of Art, followed by three years at the famed New York Studio School (NYSS) before having his first art show in New York in November 1972.</p>

            <p>His study of yoga and meditation melded together with his art practice to form a lasting bond, resulting in the deeply spiritual work that defines Shankar Gallery today.</p>

            <h3>The Collection</h3>
            <p>Shankar's Artist Collection includes over 15,000 paintings, ranging from miniatures to large 10-foot canvases. The 108 visionary paintings featured in this gallery explore themes of spiritual awakening, meditation, and the infinite expanse of consciousness.</p>

            <h3>Exhibition History</h3>
            <ul class="exhibition-list">
                <li><strong>1972</strong> - First show of oils on canvas, Brata Gallery, NYC</li>
                <li><strong>1975</strong> - Hansen Gallery, NYC (acrylic and canvas)</li>
                <li><strong>1975</strong> - Roko Gallery, NYC (calligraphy on rice papers)</li>
                <li><strong>1976</strong> - Continued NYC showings of rice paper works and paintings</li>
                <li><strong>1981</strong> - Published "Yog Mountain - Rivers to Sea"</li>
                <li><strong>1986-1991</strong> - Boulder-area exhibitions including Master Goldsmith Gallery and Naropa Institute Gallery</li>
                <li><strong>1999-Present</strong> - Shankar Gallery established as permanent exhibition space in Boulder, CO</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Philosophy</h3>
            <p>The paintings in this collection address a philosophy as old as Mount Kailash and culturally ancient as Arunachala Mountain. Through representational and abstract works, Shankar invites viewers to explore holy temples, spiritual teachers, and abstract visions of divine concepts.</p>

            <p>Each series serves as a doorway to contemplation, offering visual pilgrimages to sacred realms and meditations on the infinite nature of existence.</p>
